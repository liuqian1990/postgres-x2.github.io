    Before we proceed, you should understand the basic
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XC</SPAN
> system architecture.
    Understanding how the parts of
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XC</SPAN
> interact will make this
    chapter somewhat clearer.

   </P
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XC</SPAN
>, in short, is a collection
    of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> database clusters which act as if the whole
    collection is a single database cluster.  Based on your database design,
    each table is replicated or distributed among member databases.
   </P
><P
>    To provide this capability, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XC</SPAN
> is
    composed of three major components called GTM, Coordinator and
    Datanode.  GTM is responsible to provide ACID property of
    transactions. Datanode stores table data and handle SQL statements
    locally.  Coordinator handles each SQL statements from
    applications, determines which Datanode to go, and decomposes it
    into local SQL statements for each Datanode.
   </P
><P
>    You should run GTM in a separate server because GTM has to take
    care of transaction requirements from all the Coordinators and
    Datanodes.  To group multiple requirements and responses from
    Coordinator and Datanode running on the same server, you can
    configure GTM-Proxy.  GTM-Proxy reduces the number of interaction
    and the amount of data to GTM.  GTM-Proxy also helps to take care
    of GTM failure.
   </P
><P
>    It is a good convention to run both Coordinator and Datanode in a
    same server because we don't have to worry about workload balance
    between the two.  You can have any number of servers where these
    two components are running.  Because both Coordinator and Datanode
    are essentially PostgreSQL database, you should configure them to
    avoid resource conflict.  It is very important to assign them
    different working directory and port number.
   </P
><P
>    Postgres-XC allow multiple Coordinators which accept statments
    from applications independently but in an integrated way.  Any
    writes from any Coordinator is available from any other
    Coordinators.  They acts as if they are single database.
    Coordinator's role is to accept statments, find what Datanodes are
    involved, Ode-compose incoming statements for each Datanode if
    needed, proxy statements to target Datanode, collect the results
    and write them back to applications.
   </P
><P
>    Coordinator does not store any user data.  It stores only catalog
    data to determine how to decompose the statement, where the target
    Datanodes are, among others.  Therefore, you don't have to worry
    about Coordinator failure much.  When the Coordinator fails, you
    can just switch to the other one.
   </P
><P
>    GTM could be single point of failure (SPOF).  To prevent this, you
    can run another GTM as GTM-Standby to backup GTM's status.  When
    GTM fails, GTM-Proxy can switch to the standby on the fly.  This
    will be described in detail in high-availability sections.
   </P

    As described above, Coordinator and Datanode
    of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XC</SPAN
> are
    essentially <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> database servers. In database
    jargon, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> uses a client/server
    model.  A <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> session consists
    of the following cooperating processes (programs):

>       A server process, which manages the database files, accepts
       connections to the database from client applications, and
       performs database actions on behalf of the clients.  The
       database server program is called
       <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgres</TT
>.
       
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       The user's client (frontend) application that wants to perform
       database operations.  Client applications can be very diverse
       in nature:  a client could be a text-oriented tool, a graphical
       application, a web server that accesses the database to
       display web pages, or a specialized database maintenance tool.
       Some client applications are supplied with the




       <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XC</SPAN
> distribution; most are

       developed by users.
      </P
></LI
></UL
><P>
   </P
><P
>    As is typical of client/server applications, the client and the
    server can be on different hosts.  In that case they communicate
    over a TCP/IP network connection.  You should keep this in mind,
    because the files that can be accessed on a client machine might
    not be accessible (or might only be accessible using a different
    file name) on the database server machine.
   </P
><P
>&#13;











    The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XC</SPAN
> can handle
    multiple concurrent connections from clients.  To achieve this it
    starts (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"forks"</SPAN
>) a new process for each connection.
    From that point on, the client and the new server process
    communicate without intervention by the original
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgres</TT
> process.  Thus, the
    master server process is always running, waiting for
    client connections, whereas client and associated server processes
    come and go.  (All of this is of course invisible to the user.  We
    only mention it here for completeness.)
