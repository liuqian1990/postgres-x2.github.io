>    Postgres-XC is an open source project to provide write-scalable,
    synchronous symmetric, transparent PostgreSQL cluster
    solution. It is a collection if tightly coupled database
    components which can be installed in more than one hardware or
    virtual machines.
   </P
><P
>    Write-scalable means Postgres-XC can be configured with as many
    database servers as you want and handle much more writes (updating
    SQL statements) which single database server cannot
    do. Symmetric means you can have more than one data base
    servers which provide single database view. Synchronous means any
    database update from any database server is immediately visible to
    any other transactions running in different masters.  Transparent
    means you don't have to worry about how your data is stored in
    more than one database servers internally.

   </P
><P
>    You can configure Postgres-XC to run on more than one machines. They
    store your data in a distributed way, that is, partitioned or
    replicated way at your choice for each table.  
    <A
NAME="AEN78"
HREF="#FTN.AEN78"

CLASS="footnote"

    When you issue queries, Postgres-XC determines where the target
    data is stored and issue corresponding queries to servers with the
    target data.
   </P
><P
>    In typical web systems, you can have as many web servers or
    application servers to handle your transactions. However, you
    cannot do this for a database server in general because all the
    changing data have to be visible to all the transactions. Unlike
    other database cluster solution, Postgres-XC provides this
    capability. You can install as many database servers as you
    like. Each database server provides uniform data view to your
    applications.  Any database update from any server is immediately
    visible to applications connecting the database from other
    servers. This feature is called "synchronous multi master"
    capability and this is the most significant feature of
    Postgres-XC.

    multi-master PostgreSQL cluster with read/write scalability. That
    is, Postgres-XC should provide the following features:
    <P
></P
></P><UL
COMPACT="COMPACT"
><LI
><P
>       Postgres-XC should provide multiple servers to accept transactions and statements
from applications, which is known as "master" server in general. In Postgres-XC, this is called "Coordinator".
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Postgres-XC should provide more than one masters.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Any "master" should provide consistent database view to
       applications. Any updates from any master must be visible in
       real time manner as if such updates are done in single
       PostgreSQL server.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Tables should be able to be stored in the database in
       replicated or distributed way (known as fragment or
       partition). Replication and distribution should be transparent
       to applications, that is, such replicated and distributed table
       are seen as single table and location or number of copies of
       each record/tuple is managed by Postgres-XC and is not visible
       to applications.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Postgres-XC provides compatible PostgreSQL API to applications.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Postgres-XC should provide single and unified view of
       underlying PostgreSQL database servers so that SQL statements
       does not depend on how tables are stored in distributed way.

    </P
><P
>     As described later in this
     manual, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>'s transaction
     management is based upon MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
     technology.  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres-XC</SPAN
> extracts this
     technology into separate component as GTM so that
     any <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

     transaction management is based upon single global status.
     Details will be described in <A

><P
>     Coordinator is an interface to applications. It acts like
     conventional PostgreSQL backend process. However, Coordinator
     does not store any actual data. Actual data is stored by Datanode
     as described below. Coordinator receives SQL statements, get Global
     Transaction Id and Global Snapshot as needed, determine which
     Datanode is involved and ask them to execute (a part of)
     statement.  When issuing statement to Datanodes, it is
     associated with GXID and Global Snapshot so that Datanode is not
     confused if it receives another statement from another
     transaction originated by another Coordinator.

>Datanode</A
></H3
><P
>     Datanode actually stores your data. Tables may be distributed
     among Datanodes, or replicated to all the Datanodes.
     Datanode does not have global view of the whole database, it
     just takes care of locally stored data. Incoming statement is
     examined by the Coordinator as described next, and rebuilt to
     execute at each Datanode involved. It is then transferred to
     each Datanodes involved together with GXID and Global Snapshot
     as needed. Datanode may receive request from various
     Coordinators. However, because each the transaction is identified
     uniquely and associated with consistent (global) snapshot, data
     node doesn't have to worry what Coordinator each transaction or
     statement came from.
