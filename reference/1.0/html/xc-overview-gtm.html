     each tuple has a set of XIDs to indicate transactions which
     created and deleted the tuple. So if the target tuple is created
     by an active transaction, it is not committed or aborted and the
     transaction should ignore such tuple. In such way (in practice,
     this is done by versup module in PostgreSQL core), if we give
     each transaction a unique transaction Id throughout the system
     and maintain snapshot what transaction is active, not only in a
     single server but transaction in all the servers, we can maintain
     global consistent visibility of each tuple even when a server
     accepts new statement from other transactions running on the
     other server.

     transaction is running, such row is visible to the transaction
     which created the row, but not visible to other transactions.  If

     is visible. If the transaction was aborted, this row is not

      Coordinator backends and one GTM Proxy Thread, this thread takes
      care of one hundred Coordinator backend.

      number of interaction between GTM and the Coordinator.

     one, the pooler assigns it to the Coordinator backend. When the
     connection is no longer needed, the Coordinator backend returns
     the connection to the pooler. Pooler does not disconnect the
     connection.  It keeps the connection to the pool for later reuse,
     keeping Datanode backend running.
